# Cities Skylines Mods

This repository contains all my mods and the libraries I created that the mods use.

## Build on your own machine

Before you can build the solution you need to set an Environmental Variable called `CS_GAME_DIRECTORY` which points to the Cities_Skylines game install folder. E.g. `'C:\games\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines`

This variable is used in the .csproj files to locate the dll files provided by the game
